Thank you for your comments on the initial submission. I have made the following changes in response:

1. The tips that overlapped with Brown & Wilson 2018 have been replaced.

2. Discussion of co-teaching has been clarified.

3. The discussion of inclusivity has been split in two (inclusive language as Tip 9, and enforcing a code of conduct as Tip 10).

4. Minor typographical errors have been corrected.

I hope you enjoy reading the revised manuscript, and I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Greg Wilson
