To whom it may concern,

I wish to submit the paper "Ten Quick Tips for Delivering Programming Lessons" for publication in PLOS Computational Biology. I hope you enjoy it, and I look forward to hearing from you.  Please note that this is a resubmission of PCOMPBIOL-D-19-01046 with the word 'rule' changed to 'tip'.

Best regards,
Dr. Greg Wilson
